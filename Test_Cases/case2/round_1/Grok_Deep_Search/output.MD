This survey note aims to provide a detailed examination of the latest advancements in deep research, focusing on the tools developed by major tech companies, their capabilities, applications, and the challenges they present. The analysis is grounded in recent developments, with a focus on the current year, April 14, 2025, and draws from authoritative sources to ensure accuracy and relevance.

#### Defining Deep Research
Deep research, in this context, refers to AI-powered tools designed to perform in-depth, multi-step research on complex topics using data from the public web. These tools autonomously search for, read, and synthesize information from diverse online sources, generating thorough, documented, and clearly cited reports. This interpretation is supported by multiple sources, including a blog post by Leehan Chung ([The Differences between Deep Research, Deep Research, and Deep Research](https://leehanchung.github.io/blogs/2025/02/26/deep-research/)), which compares it to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and notes its implementation by frontier AI labs, and OpenAI's official FAQ ([Deep Research FAQ | OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10500283-deep-research-faq)), which describes it as a specialized capability fine-tuned on the o3 reasoning model.

The term has been adopted by various companies, with Google's Gemini Deep Research ([Gemini Deep Research - your personal research assistant](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/?hl=en)) and xAI's Grok DeepSearch, among others, contributing to a broad ecosystem of deep research tools. This survey note will focus on the most prominent implementations by OpenAI and Google, given their detailed documentation and widespread availability.

#### Latest Advancements in Deep Research

##### OpenAI's Deep Research
As of February 25, 2025, OpenAI has made its Deep Research feature available to all users on paid plans, including Plus, Team, Enterprise, Edu, and Pro, across all platforms (web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows). This advancement marks a significant expansion in access, with the following details:

- **Technical Foundation**: Powered by the upcoming OpenAI o3 reasoning model, which enhances its ability to perform in-depth, multi-step research using public web data.
- **Access and Limits**: 
  - Pro plan users receive 120 deep research queries per month, while Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users get 10 queries per month.
  - Limits reset every 30 days, ensuring regular access for users.
- **Usage and Features**: Users can select 'Deep Research' in ChatGPT, attach images, files, or spreadsheets for context, and may be prompted to fill out a form for parameters. The process takes 5-30 minutes, during which a sidebar displays the thought process and websites visited. The final output is a detailed report, with upcoming features including embedded images and data visualizations, though no exact release date is provided.
- **Compliance Integration**: As of March 10, 2025, Enterprise customers can integrate Deep Research with the Compliance API, searching for "deep research global prompt" or looking for `{"tool_name":"deep_research"}` in the response ([Compliance API for Enterprise Customers | OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9261474-compliance-api-for-enterprise-customers)).
- **Data Access**: The tool accesses open web data and uploaded files across conversations but does not include private data such as subscription-based or internal resources, with plans for future expansion.

OpenAI's Deep Research is particularly effective at finding niche, non-intuitive information that would involve multiple steps across numerous websites, making it ideal for intense knowledge work in areas like finance, science, and law, as well as for researchers and discerning shoppers. A Nature article ([OpenAI’s ‘deep research’ tool: is it useful for scientists?](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00377-9)) highlights its potential for generating cited, pages-long reports that could assist in literature reviews, though it notes the need for critical evaluation.

##### Google's Gemini Deep Research
Google launched Gemini Deep Research in December 2024, initially powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro, and has since upgraded to Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking for improved quality and efficiency, with Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) available in Gemini Advanced for enhanced research capabilities. Key advancements include:

- **Technical Challenges and Solutions**:
  - **Multi-step Planning**: Effective long planning that is data-efficient and open domain, capable of handling all topics.
